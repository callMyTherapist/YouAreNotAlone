<p class=Textbody>I. MY PLEDGE REGARDING HEALTH INFORMATION:<br>
I understand that health information about you and your health care is
personal. I am committed to protecting health information about you. I create a
record of the care and services you receive from me. I need this record to
provide you with quality care and to comply with certain legal requirements.
This notice applies to <span class=GramE>all of</span> the records of your care
generated by this mental health care practice. This notice will tell you about
the ways in which I may use and disclose health information about you. I also
describe your rights to the health information I keep about <span class=GramE>you,
and</span> describe certain obligations I have regarding the use and disclosure
of your health information. I am required by law to:<o:p></o:p></p>

</span></span></span><![endif]>I can change the terms of this Notice, and such
changes will apply to all information I have about you. The new Notice will be
available upon request, in my office, and on my website.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Textbody>II. HOW I MAY USE AND DISCLOSE HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT YOU:<br>
The following categories describe different ways that I use and disclose health
information. For each category of uses or disclosures I will explain what I
mean and try to give some examples. Not every use or disclosure in a category
will be listed. However, <span class=GramE>all of</span> the ways I am
permitted to use and disclose information will fall within one of the
categories.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Textbody>For Treatment Payment, or Health Care Operations: Federal
privacy rules (regulations) allow health care providers who have direct
treatment relationship with the patient/client to use or disclose the
patient/client’s personal health information without the patient’s written
authorization, to carry out the health care provider’s own treatment, <span
class=GramE>payment</span> or health care operations. I may also disclose your
protected health information for the treatment activities of any health care
provider. This too can be done without your written authorization. For example,
if a clinician were to consult with another licensed health care provider about
your condition, we would be permitted to use and disclose your personal health
information, which is otherwise confidential, <span class=GramE>in order to</span>
assist the clinician in diagnosis and treatment of your mental health
condition.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Textbody>Disclosures for treatment purposes are not limited to the
minimum necessary standard. Because therapists and other health care providers
need access to the full record and/or full and complete information <span
class=GramE>in order to</span> provide quality care. The word “treatment”
includes, among other things, the coordination and management of health care
providers with a third party, consultations between health care providers and
referrals of a patient for health care from one health care provider to
another.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Textbody>Lawsuits and Disputes: If you are involved in a lawsuit, I
may disclose health information in response to a court or administrative order.
I may also disclose health information about your child in response to a
subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process by someone else involved
in the dispute, but only if efforts have been made to tell you about the
request or to obtain an order protecting the information requested.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=Textbody>III. CERTAIN USES AND DISCLOSURES REQUIRE YOUR AUTHORIZATION:<o:p></o:p></p>

Notes. I do keep “psychotherapy notes” as that term is defined in 45 CFR §
164.501, and any use or disclosure of such notes requires your Authorization
unless the use or disclosure is:<br>
a. For my use in treating you.<br>

them improve their skills in group, joint, family, or individual counseling or
therapy.<br>
